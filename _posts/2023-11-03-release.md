## :book: Notes

Just a small release, this time.

Behind the scenes, I added a lot of tests for the colour code.
This revealed a handful of bugs that needed fixing.
Whilst testing, I converted some debug code to create the `:color` command.
Maybe not _that_ useful, but it's quite pretty :smile:

Also new, the information screens like `:set` allow you to save their contents with `s` (`<save-message>`).
